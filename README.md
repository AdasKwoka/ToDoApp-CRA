# Description

A classic ToDo app designed to help you manage your tasks.

## Functionality

Using this application we are able to add new tasks to be completed on a given day. We are able to set their priority and the exact date by which we want to complete the task. After adding a task we can freely remove it or consider it finished. Completed tasks are shown on the other side of the application with the exact time of its completion.

## Technology

The application was created using CRA. I used concepts such as stateful components and stateless function components in it. They were placed in separate components and named according to their functionality. I showed the data flow from the parent component to the lower layers and the skillful use of the state.
